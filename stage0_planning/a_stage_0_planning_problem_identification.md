# A. Stage 0 - Planning and Problem Identification
Train service is something used by many and a usable app is mandatory for everyone to be able to buy a ticket from it, or check schedules or other information regarding the trains like delays or strikes.

# Context
Existing train app (CP app with 2.5-star rating) lacks usability, causing frustration for tasks like ticket purchases, schedule checks, and delay alerts. A simpler, proactive app is needed.
This is a relevant topic for us, given that most of us have to use the train to come to university, and it is a topic that constantly gets critisized.


# Challenges
- Providing real-time updates (delays, strikes).
- Simplifying repetitive tasks (e.g., payments).
- Balancing usability for both daily and occasional users.

# The goal
Design a user-friendly train app to address core frustrations: ticket management, real-time alerts, and streamlined workflows.
