# B. Stage 1 - Context Definition


# B.1. Competitor Identification
>	The competitor analysis will entail an identification of all competitors, with brief descriptions and a collection of the look and feel of their solutions, e.g., with screenshots, etc. It will also include a detailed analysis of the competitor deemed the best or more representative.



## B.1a. Competitors


| **Competitor**    		| **Description**                             				| Information repository              	|
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Comboios de Portugal (CP)	| National train service provider with a poorly rated app	| [[Competitor Analysis CP]] 			|

| Rede Expressos            | Leading Portuguese intercity bus company                  | [[Competitor Analysis RedeExpressos]] |




## B.1b. Detailed Competitor Analysis
>	Choose the most notable competitor and do a more thorough analysis of their interactive solution


### - Heuristic Evaluation

#### Method

- Procedure: Two evaluators assessed the CP app using Nielsenâ€™s 10 heuristics.
- Severity Scale: 1 (Low severity) to 4 (Critical).
- Consensus: Final ratings averaged between evaluators (Bruno and JoÃ£o).


#### Individual Evaluations


- [expert1_heuristic_evaluation_workbook](heuristic_evaluations/expert1_heuristic_evaluation_workbook.md)

- [expert2_heuristic_evaluation_workbook](heuristic_evaluations/expert2_heuristic_evaluation_workbook.md)

- [expert3_heuristic_evaluation_workbook](heuristic_evaluations/expert3_heuristic_evaluation_workbook.md)


#### Consensus

>	After the individual analysis by each expert, all results should be gathered in a consensus table. If an expert has not found any of the problems found by other experts, they should analyse it, at this point, and give it a severity.

| **Issue**       										| **Bruno** 	| **JoÃ£o** |  Recommendations                            |

# B.2. Users
>	For the users, there are two goals: 1) understand the current status of users in the domain you are addressing. How do they manage, what are the main tasks they do, if they use some tool for the purpose, what are current challenges, what might be improved, what might be new features, ...


## B.2a. Method
- Approach: Conducted 6 semi-structured interviews with daily commuters and occasional travelers.

- Goal: Understand pain points (e.g., payment inefficiency, lack of alerts) and desired features.

- Questions: [EntrevistaPerguntas](Interviews/EntrevistaPerguntas.md)

## B.2b. Results

>	This section tracks all informal user interviews, summarizing key insights and linking to detailed notes for each session.
